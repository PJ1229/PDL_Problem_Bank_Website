    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        Welcome to the Lab's "Problem Bank Website"!
        This website is dedicated to taking problems from the community and solving them with our resources here at the lab. 
        Just enter a problem you have below, so our Team STEM Members can come up with an innovative solution for it! 
        This idea has been heavily inspired by "The Dawson Problem Bank".
        If you want to learn more, click the button at the top of the page titled "Dawson Problem Bank".

    <!-- Criteria -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: -12px;">
        <b>What is a good problem to submit?</b>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">
        A good problem for our Problem Bank follows the following criteria: authenticity, urgency, size, simplicity, and impact. 
        While an ideal problem would accurately depict this criteria, please do not feel discouraged about submitting a problem that does not. 
        Any problem you have can be submitted, but if it follows this criteria, there is a higher chance of it being solved! 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Authenticity: </b><br>&emsp;The problem is authentic, and the materials at the lab are needed to solve it.</li>
        <li><b>Urgency: </b><br>&emsp;There is ample time to solve the problem. Our team members need time to think of solutions and respond.</li>
        <li><b>Size: </b><br>&emsp;The solution is small. We have limited resources at the lab, so the problem should not require a lot.</li>
        <li><b>Simplicity: </b><br>&emsp;The problem is solvable! This may seem obvious, but the problem should be relatively simple.</li>
        <li><b>Impact: </b><br>&emsp;The problem is important! A good problem is a problem that is shared with many people.</li>
    </ul>
